# Havelaer

Hi, my name is Max Meinders and I enjoy building stuff that people like to use.

My main skill set is focussed around frontend technologies, particularly [React](https://react.dev) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org). But I also have broad experience across the full-stack spectrum, including Docker, PostgreSQL, Node.js, GCP, Playwright, and more.
